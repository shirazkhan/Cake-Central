# amp-react-theme
A super fast responsive generic theme created with React and NextJS from scratch that is also AMP compliant.

All the components, styling and code is done by scratch with minimalistic javascript for efficient performance.

This is a greate boilerplate theme that will target successful SEO, performance, and user experience.

By incorporating a headless Wordpress installation, this application will grab content via Wordpress REST Api for a SSR (Server Side Rendered) experience.

This project also supports AMP pages thanks to Next JS. The AMP pages will be very similar in design to the normal UI. This creates an even more dynamic experience, super fast performance, and extra SEO points from Google.

UPDATE:
This Project will no longer support AMP as Google has officially announced that using AMP will not have a massive positive SEO advantage compared to before. In my opinion user experiences are more important than a slight SEO increase.

### Technologies used:
