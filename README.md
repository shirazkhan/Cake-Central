# NextJS + Shopify Starter Kit
A super fast responsive generic theme created with React and NextJS from scratch.

All the components, styling and code is done from scratch with minimalistic direct DOM manipulation for efficient performance.

This is a greate boilerplate theme that will target successful SEO, performance, and user experience.

This starter kit will utilise the Shopify StoreFront API and use Apollo as the client to communicate with the GraphQL API.

It also features a connection to a headless Wordpress installation. This will grab content via the Wordpress REST Api.

Content will be displayed using SSR (Server Side Rendering) technology to allow users to experience blazing performance and bots to efficiently index valuable content.

This project also supports AMP pages thanks to Next JS. The AMP pages will be very similar in design to the normal UI. This creates an even more dynamic experience, super fast performance, and extra SEO points from Google.

UPDATE:
This Project will no longer support AMP as Google has officially announced that using AMP will not have a massive positive SEO advantage compared to before. In my opinion user experiences are more important than a slight SEO increase.
